# Find Libraries

You will run into the most popular libraries pretty quickly since the Elixir community tends to not create 10-times the same thing, but rather gather around one or two libraries that get the job done.

However, if you want to browse a bit, these are good resources:

* [Essential Libraries for Elixir Developers](https://brittonbroderick.com/2022/12/02/essential-libraries-for-elixir-developers/)
* [Awesome Elixir](https://github.com/h4cc/awesome-elixir)
* [Elixir Toolbox](https://elixirtoolbox.dev/)
