# Hello World!

If you want to run the following code yourself, there are three options:

1. Start an IEx REPL with `iex -S mix` and copy and paste the code into the command line.
2. Copy and paste the code into an Elixir script file, like `script.exs`, and run `mix run script.exs`.
3. **Recommended**: Install [Livebook](https://livebook.dev/) and simply click the `Run in Livebook` button above each file to open it in an interactive notebook.

## Hello World

Here's how you write a `Hello World` script in Elixir.

```elixir
IO.inspect("Hello World!")
```

<!-- livebook:{"output":true} -->

```
"Hello World!"
```

## Variable Assignment

Assigning a value to a variable is super simple in Elixir. You just write `my_var =` and whatever is on the right side of the `=` sign gets assigned to the variable. Here is how to assign all the different basic types to variables:

```elixir
name = "Peter" # String
age = 32 # Integer
age_hex = 0x20 # Integer in hexadecimal
height = 190.47 # Float
height_sci = 1.9047e2 # Float in scientific notation
adult? = true # Boolean
status = :active # Atom
address = nil # The 'None/null/Nil' value

IO.inspect([name, age, age_hex, height, height_sci, adult?, status, address])
```

<!-- livebook:{"output":true} -->

```
["Peter", 32, 32, 190.47, 190.47, true, :active, nil]
```

Variables are **immutable** but can be reassigned. This means that the memory holding the old value will not be overwritten; instead, new memory is allocated to hold the new value while the old value remains until garbage collected. Even if you modify a variable, it is not updated in place but copied to a new chunk of memory. This might seem wasteful, but it prevents different processes from modifying the same variable.

```elixir
age = 32
age = 21
IO.inspect(age)
```

<!-- livebook:{"output":true} -->

```
21
```

You can ignore assignments by prefixing the variable name with an underscore:

```elixir
_ = 30
_result = 30 + 32
```

## String Interpolation and Concatenation

You can interpolate and concatenate strings like this:

```elixir
# Interpolate a string with values
name = "Peter"
age = 32
IO.inspect("My name is #{name} and I am #{age} years old")

# Concatenate two strings
IO.inspect("But my real name is " <> "Batman ðŸ¦‡")
```

<!-- livebook:{"output":true} -->

```
"My name is Peter and I am 32 years old"
"But my real name is Batman ðŸ¦‡"
```
